# Bug Reporting & Discussion Repository
This is the Meadows Network's Report Repo! Where you can open an issue for network problems / bugs that need to be reported.

Note that all issues reported must be clearly documented, otherwise it will be closed without notice.

You can use the **Issues** tab to report bugs and issues with the network

You can use the **Discussions** tab to discuss bug finding and to chat with your fellow bug hunters
